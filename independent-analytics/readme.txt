**Who Made This?**

Independent Analytics is designed and developed by Ben Sibley and Andrew Mead in the beautiful city of Philadelphia. Check out [our interview](https://wpbuilds.com/2025/06/26/426-why-independent-analytics-could-be-the-wordpress-alternative-to-google-analytics-youve-been-waiting-for/) on the WP Builds podcast if you’d like to hear our story.

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install Independent Analytics is by visiting your **Plugins > Add New** menu. Search for "Independent Analytics" and install the first result you see there.

To install with the zip file downloaded from this page:

1. Login to your WordPress dashboard
2. Visit the **Plugins > Add New** menu
3. Click the **Upload Plugin** button at the top
4. In the upload form that appears, click the **Choose file** button and select the **independent-analytics.zip** file you downloaded here
5. Click the **Install Now** button
6. Once the page reloads, click the blue **Activate** link

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install it? =
No, Independent Analytics is an alternative to Google Analytics.

= Can I use Independent Analytics and Google Analytics at the same time? =
Yes, you can run them both simultaneously without any issues or errors.

= Can I import data from Google Analytics or Jetpack Stats? =
No, it is not possible to import stats from other analytics tools at this time.

= Will it slow down my site? =
No, the tracking script makes a deferred request to your site's REST API to record the visit. This has no impact on the loading experience, and does not impact your Core Web Vitals, allowing you to achieve a perfect 100/100 Page Speed Insights score.

= Does tracking start right away? =
Yes, the moment you install Independent Analytics it will start tracking views. If you don't see any views right away, clear your site's cache and then visit your site in a private browser tab to record your first view.

= Do I need to use a cookie popup with it? =
No, Independent Analytics does not use cookies.

= How much space does it take in my database? =
Independent Analytics will store roughly 200-300MB per million sessions. We find this amount of data to be reasonable for the vast majority of websites. There is also an option to automatically delete old data, so you can store only the last 1-5 years of analytics.

= Are bot visits counted? =
Independent Analytics ignores all self-identifying bots, such as search engine crawlers and uptime checkers. If you are getting visits from malicious bots that disguise themselves as human visitors, we recommend using Cloudflare or the Shield Security plugin to block these bots from accessing your website.

= Is there a tracking code? =
Yes, but you don't have to add it yourself. It gets included on all of your site's pages automatically once Independent Analytics is activated.

= Does it work with multisite installs? =
Yes, Independent Analytics works well with multisite installs. Each sub-site will get its own Analytics menu with its own stats.

= What metrics does it track? =
The primary metrics it tracks are views, visitors, sessions, session duration, bounce rate, and average session duration.

= Does it work if I use Matomo? =
Yes, Independent Analytics will run smoothly and won't create any errors even if you're already using Matomo or any other analytics plugin.
